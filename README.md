## Project overview

Building on the skills I learnt from my [first pygame project](https://github.com/ddottyler/Space-invaders), this project is a simple locally run 2 player pygame application.

Shoot the other ship to win!

## How to run the project

Note - you will need pygame and python installed to use this app.

Once you have cloned and opened the repo:

- Run the path of the python and the main.py file in the command line. On my system, this looks like this:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/python3 /Users/dantyler/Coding-Projects/Space-Shooter/main.py
```

- Alternatively, if using VS Code, use the built in python play button in the top right hand corner while main.py is open.

## How to control the players

Blue

- Move = arrow keys
- Shoot = Spacebar

Yellow:

- Up = w
- Down = s
- Left = a
- Right = d
- Shoot = f
